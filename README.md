## Web-Based Voice Tester (Client-Side TTS, Simulated ASR)

This repository also includes a web-based tool for testing voice interaction concepts.
It allows uploading an audio file (ASR is simulated) and features client-side Text-to-Speech for AI responses.

*   **Access the Web Tester:** [Link to be added after GitHub Pages setup for this file]
*   **File:** `web_tester_client_tts.html`

**Note:** The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the uploaded audio file is **simulated** in this web version. The Text-to-Speech (TTS) for AI responses is handled directly by your browser.
